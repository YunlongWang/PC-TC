function [RD, CD, order]=optics_JClust(feature, minpts)
% Description:
%
% Ordering Points of a data set To Identify the Clustering Structure. To understand algorithm, see References below.
% 
% Input: 
% 'feature' = dataset(m,n): m = observations, n = variables
% 'minpts' = number of points in a neighborhood of the selected point
% (minimal number of points considered as a cluster)
% 
% Output: 
% 'RD' - vector with reachability distances for each point
% 'CD' - vector with core distances for each point
% 'order' - vector specifying the order of points as determined by minimum spanning tree
